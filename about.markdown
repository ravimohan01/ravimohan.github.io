## My Research Focus

Polymer Informatics is an emerging field that leverages computational methods, machine learning, and data science to advance our understanding of polymeric materials. My work addresses several key areas:

- **Accurate Polymer Representation**: Developing computational models that can effectively capture the complex structure-property relationships in polymers
- **Multi-scale Property Computation**: Bridging the gap between molecular-level characteristics and macroscopic material properties
- **Application Prediction**: Using predictive models to determine the suitability of polymers for specific end-product applications
- **Degradation and Wear Analysis**: Understanding how polymers behave under various service conditions and storage environments
